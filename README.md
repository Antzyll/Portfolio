# Tony’s Front-End Development Portfolio

This repository highlights a mix of **personal builds** and **client projects** I’ve contributed to as a front-end developer.  
The full source code is kept private to protect intellectual property, but each project includes screenshots and a short case study.

## What I Do
- Develop responsive websites and apps with **React, Next.js, and React Native**  
- Style interfaces with **Tailwind CSS**, **Chakra UI**, and modern CSS practices  
- Build and maintain **WordPress websites** for clients (themes, plugins, customisation)  
- Use **SQL and database integration** where projects require dynamic data  
- Integrate APIs (Firebase, REST, GraphQL)  
- Deliver clean, accessible, and user-friendly UI/UX  

## Projects
- [Chatlingo](./Chatlingo/README.md) — Mobile translation app (React Native + Firebase)  
- [Lucidrift](./Lucidrift/README.md) — Dream journaling PWA (Next.js + Firebase)  
- (More client websites and projects coming soon)
