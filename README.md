I enjoy building **projects** and **websites** that solve real problems while exploring new technologies along the way.  
For me, development isn’t just about code - it’s about creating clean, responsive designs, integrating systems that make life easier, and experimenting for the fun of it!  

This portfolio is a collection of my work:  
- 🛠 Personal projects where I test ideas and new tools  
- 🌐 Client websites built with a focus on design + usability  
- 🚀 Explorations into APIs, integrations, and the occasional full-stack experiment for fun and to make my front-end builds more dynamic!
