# Tonyâ€™s Project Portfolio

Welcome ðŸ‘‹ This repository showcases selected projects Iâ€™ve designed and built as a front-end developer.  
The full source code is kept private to protect IP, but screenshots and case studies are provided for each project.

## What I Do
- Build responsive web apps and mobile apps with React, Next.js, and React Native  
- Style with modern frameworks like Tailwind CSS and Chakra UI  
- Integrate with APIs (Firebase, REST, GraphQL)  
- Focus on clean UI, accessibility, and user-friendly design
