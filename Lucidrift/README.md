## Overview
**Lucidrift** is a progressive web app (PWA) for logging dreams in a beautiful, immersive interface.  
I focused heavily on the **front-end design and user experience**: glass-card layouts, animated UI transitions, and a painterly night-sky theme that adapts across devices.

## Features
- 🖌️ **Custom UI/UX design** — homepage, backgrounds, journaling interface designed by me  
- 💻 **Progressive Web App (PWA)** — responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile, installable like an app  
- 🔐 **Firebase integration** — lightweight authentication & cloud storage  
- 🌙 **Dream journaling system** — log and revisit dreams through an elegant interface  
- 🎨 **AI-enhanced visuals** — users’ dreams generate images and comics via ComfyUI + Brainstorm AI *(requires online access)*  
- 🎞️ **Dream reels** — entries can be compiled into short “weekly dream movies” *(upcoming feature)*

- 🎞️ Export weekly “Dream Reel” videos automatically  
- 🎬 Generate small dream-based movies with audio & transitions  
- 🎨 More dynamic themes (day/night cycles, adaptive colors)
