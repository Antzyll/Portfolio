# 📂 Projects

**This is where ideas turn into apps and PWAs! Anything from small sparks to bigger builds that actually feel alive.  
I love experimenting with frameworks, testing new approaches, and seeing how far I can push a concept.  
Some projects are practical, some are just for fun, but all of them carry my focus on clean design and smooth user experiences.**
